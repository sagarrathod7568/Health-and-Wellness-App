            Consistency Over Intensity: Focus on regular workouts rather than
            pushing too hard in a single session. Small, consistent efforts
            yield long-term results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mind-Muscle Connection: Concentrate on the muscles you're working
            during each exercise. This improves form and maximizes gains from
            every rep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rest and Recovery: Ensure you get adequate rest between workouts.
            Muscles grow and repair during recovery, making rest just as
            important as exercise.
